The e-mail address and password used while configuring your Tesla will be your login for your Tesla Account. Here, you can continue to make changes to your design up until the end of your three day window. The Delivery Team will contact you once you have a VIN assigned, and your Tesla enters production. The most current production timing can be found online in the Design studio before you place your order. </td>

Please note that all information in your Tesla Account directly affects the spelling and punctuation on your registration documents. Your account also includes links for financing and trade-ins.</td>

Credit cards can only be used for the initial deposit. Please confirm your method of payment with your Tesla representative prior to Delivery Day, as in some states, we must receive payment before delivery, and therefore cannot accept a payment at time of pick-up.</td>
